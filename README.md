## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Description of what each file shows:
0. Bubble sort
1. Insertion sort
2. Selection sort
3. Quick sort
